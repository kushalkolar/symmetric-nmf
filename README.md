Symmetric NMF in python

Implemention of Symmetric NMF in Python because I could not find a python implementation.

Based on https://github.com/dakuang/symnmf

Warning: Not rigourly tested yet, use at your own risk. Works with toy data, need to verify with a diverse range of datasets before I can say that this works properly.

Symmetric NMF allows for soft clustering, for example see row 2 here which belongs to both cluster 1 and cluster 2.
